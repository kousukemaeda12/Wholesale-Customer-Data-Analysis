# Wholesale Customer Transactional Sales Data ETL Project

In this project, we implement a method to extract transactional sales data, and transform it to a form where we can see how much each customers spent for each food category, and finally output the result(csv) into a new directory DATA. We use jupyter as our notebook, s3 to store the data, and EC2 to compute. Also, we use the pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib library to do exploratory data analysis and understand the data.
